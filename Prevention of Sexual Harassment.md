# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What is sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment means doing something that makes another person feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a bad way. It can be:

- Saying bad or dirty jokes
- Showing or sharing bad pictures or videos
- Sending messages that feel wrong or scary
- Touching someone without asking
- Looking at someone in a bad way
- Asking for wrong favors
- Following someone again and again
- Talking badly about someone’s private life
- Asking someone to go out even after they say no
- Saying or doing anything that makes someone feel scared or hurt

Sexual harassment can happen by talking, touching, or sending messages. It can happen in the office, at work events, or even online if it is about work. It can happen to boys or girls.

## What should you do if you see or face sexual harassment?

If I see or face sexual harassment, I will:

- Stay calm and safe  
- Tell the person to stop if I feel safe  
- Tell the company’s Internal Committee  
- Write down what happened with the time, place, and names  
- Help the person who is hurt if I see it happen  
- Never laugh at or ignore such things  
- Follow the company’s safety rules  

MountBlue has rules to stop sexual harassment. They help to keep everyone safe. You can tell the problem by writing or sending an email. The Internal Committee will listen and keep it secret. They will take the right action.

We all must help each other feel safe at work. Always speak up if something wrong happens.
