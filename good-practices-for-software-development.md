# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

Some new points for me were:

- **Joining meetings 5-10 minutes early** to build rapport with the team.  
- **Sharing all your questions in one single message** instead of many small ones.  
- **Using apps like Boosted** to track time and improve productivity.  
- **Turning on video during meetings** to improve communication.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I need to improve on **communicating clearly when I'm stuck**.

Sometimes, I just say things like "itâ€™s not working" instead of explaining the exact issue.

To improve:
- I will explain the problem properly.
- I will mention what I have already tried.
- I will use screenshots or code snippets to make it clear.
- I will try using tools like Loom or CodeSandbox if needed.
